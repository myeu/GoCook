    "In bowl of food processor, combine two flours, salt, baking powder and baking soda. Pulse several times to blend. Add frozen butter. Pulse until pieces are size of peas. Don't overprocess or let dough come together.",
    "Transfer flour mixture to large bowl. Make well in centre. Pour in 1-1/2 cups buttermilk. Stir and lift mixture with wooden spoon, gently working flour into buttermilk. Dough should begin to come together but not form solid mass or biscuits may be tough. Turn dough out onto lightly-floured surface. Pat into 3/4-inch rectangle, about 9 inches by 13 inches.",
    "Using 2-1/2-inch round cutter (or bottom of glass), cut out biscuits. Dough trimmings can be gently pushed together, patted out and cut one more time.",
    "Place biscuits, 1-inch apart, on parchment-lined baking sheets. Brush tops with remaining 2 tablespoons buttermilk.",
    "Bake in preheated 425F oven 15 to 18 minutes, rotating pans halfway through, until golden. If desired, brush with melted butter. Serve warm. Makes about 18."
